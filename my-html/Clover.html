    <h1>Clover Kingdom</h1> 
    <h2>Hello, I am Rovelyn Paradero</h2>
    <p>
        I was born under mysterious circumstances and raised in the shadows of the Kingdom. Trained in Illusion Magic, I showed a rare talent for creating lifelike illusions from a young age.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an outcast, I found strength in solitude. My shadow-based illusions now serve as tools for deception and reconnaissance, making me a valuable asset in any mission.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though quiet and distant, I’m fiercely loyal to those I trust. I struggle to balance my true self with the expectations of the Magic Knights.
    </p>
    <p>
        My greatest challenge lies within — mastering the dark edge of my power and forging my own destiny, no longer living in the shadow of others.
