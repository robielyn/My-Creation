    <h1>ðŸŒ¿ The Path of Life</h1>
    
    <p>
       Life is a river, flowing free,<br> winding through each mystery.
       <br>With calm and storm, it finds its way, <br>from golden dawn to end of day. 
       <br>It teaches lessons, soft and deep, <br>in moments loud, and those we keep. 
      <br> Through every loss and every gain, <br>it whispers growth behind the pain. 
       <br>It blooms in joy, it bends in strife,<br> each breath a thread that weaves a life. 
      <br> So walk the path with open eyes, <br>and greet the world beneath the skies.
